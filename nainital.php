                                        the right place to be is Ranikhet. According to a popular belief, this spot had won the heart of Rani Padmini, queen of Raja Sudhardev. She chose this scenic place to be her abode and since then, it has come to
                                        be known as Ranikhet, literally “Queen’s Field”. At an altitude of 1829mtres, above sea level, the invigorating mountain breeze, the singing of birds, the panoramic view of the Himalayas – the sights, sounds and
                                        smells leave the onlooker spellbound. During the rains, flowers sprout up every where in rainbow colours, branches of tress stoop with ripened fruits and sunlight peeping through the mist and clouds, endow an enchanting
                                        effect all across Ranikhet. As winter comes, the softly falling snowflakes cover the environs in sheets of pure whiteness.</p>
