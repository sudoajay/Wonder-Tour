                    About 1370 kilometre east of mainland India, the archipelago that is <strong> Andaman Islands</strong> in the Bay of Bengal with Myanmar to the east and north, is an idyllic landscape of translucent waters, sun-dappled, white beaches,
                    mangrove wilderness and coconut groves offering a cool shade to your hammock as it sways gently in the wind.</p><br><br>
                <p class="text-block">
                    A part of the Union Territory of Andaman and Nicobar Islands, the Andaman Islands are settled by Tamil, Telugu, Bengali, Myanmarese and Nicobarese folk, though they are primarily home to the indigenous Jarawa and Sentinelese tribes. Of the 572 islands
                    including the Myanmar-controlled Coco Islands in the north, only a few can be accessed by tourists, the remaining are out of bounds to protect the right to privacy of the Sentinelese who are to this day wary of contact with the outside
                    world.
